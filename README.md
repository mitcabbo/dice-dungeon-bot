# DiceDungeonBot

DiceDungeonBot is a JavaScript Discord bot for online tabletop gamers. Roll dice, make decisions, or flip a coin by using commands to interact with the Discord Bot.

This project will be my personal take on more popular bots that are available for tabletop gamers, such as Dice Maiden, Avrae, or Rolisteam.
